            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p class="disc">
              North zone’s biggest annual techno-managerial fest is being held
              from 25th to 28th February 2023 on its campus and we’d love to see
              you among us at the event. There’s so much in it for everyone,
              from coding geeks to start-up enthusiasts, from gamers to
              designers, from drone shows to ATV races, from robo wars to a
              fashion parade. It’ll be one stop for all the technological and
              design enthusiasts from all domains. Teams from colleges and
              universities across the nation will be participating in the
              events. The prizes for winners are as exciting as the
              competitions. We thus invite you to complement us in our
              celebration of technology. NIT Jalandhar
